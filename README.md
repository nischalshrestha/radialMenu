# Radial Menu

Radial menus can be a really quick way to perform common actions like sharing an image as it takes advantage of the hold and drag gesture.

If the menu is right at the bottom corner of the screen, it allows you to simply use your thumb to hold down, drag and select an item quickly. Since the menu items are usually set in its rightful place or direction (left, right, diagonal), the user can quickly memorize the direction without much mental effort.

I made a prototype on Framer that demonstrates the power of radial menus when it comes to mobile phones. It's a simple example of how radial menus could be used to share an image.
